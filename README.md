Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the design of high quallity softwares responding to the needs. It's important since it allows automatizing complex tasks in an efficient way.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Front-end engineering: the design of interfaces
Back-end engineering: the design of databases
Prompt engineering: The ability to ask an AI precise needs

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Analysis: Identifying the needs for the software by means of analysis
Implementation: Coding the software
Maintenance: Correcting the bugs and improving the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:
When the project requirements are clear and unlikely to change.
When you have a well-defined scope (e.g., regulatory compliance projects, construction).
When the project needs extensive documentation at each phase.
Agile:
When the project needs to be flexible and adaptive to change.
When you have evolving or unclear requirements (e.g., software startups, creative design projects).
When you want to release parts of the project frequently for customer feedback (e.g., software apps, products under development).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: He is the person in charge of writing the code of the software.
Quality Assurance Engineer: He is the one in charge of testing the code.
Project Manager: He is the one in charge of leading the developers towards the expectations of the customer.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are softwares facilitating the compilation, coding, debugging of a software. Eg: Visual Studio, Android Studio
VCS allow the management of a code by contributors who are the developers. Eg: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges include the analysis of the needs of the client, communication among the developers, lack of testing. 
These challenges can be overcome by a good analysis, good communication among the developers and the using of automated and manual tests.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
The unit testing is only on a specific part of a functionality.
The integration testing is about a whole functionality.
The system testing is about the testing of the whole software.
The acceptance testing is the testing of the software in order to see if it is line with the client expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about finding the good way to prompt an AI about our specific needs. 
It's important because it allows to use an AI in the most efficient way.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me how to solve an error in Angular.
Specific prompt: Tell me how to solve the dependencies errors in Angular.
The last prompt will be more effective because it's more accurate.
